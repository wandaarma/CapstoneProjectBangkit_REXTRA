## Simple Description About Our Project
In this project, we create machine learning that is used to to recommend extracurricular activities. This method aligns with the skills that users want to develop and the activities they have previously participated in. By analyzing the content of each activity, we can identify similarities with the userâ€™s interests and past experiences, providing personalized recommendations that enhance their portfolio and career prospects.
